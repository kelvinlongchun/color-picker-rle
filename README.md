# Overview

This project is inspired by [Microsoft's PowerToys Color Picker](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/color-picker). I am a Windows user. And this softwore tool is very useful in my daily programmer life.

One day, I was coding and I had a childish idea: What if we can use Color Picker in real lifeðŸ¤”? So I created this completely useless web application: **Color Picker - Real Life Edition** (Yes, I am a big fan of Skyrim lolðŸ¤Ÿ).

# Get Started

1. Go to url: [https://color-picker-rle.vercel.app](https://color-picker-rle.vercel.app) (It will have better experience if you are using a mobile phone to open the appðŸ“±).
2. Allow camera access on the browser.
3. You should see the front sight ðŸ‘† on the camera feed area. It will pick the color at the point automatically.
4. You can also click any point on the camera feed area. The location of the front sight will be updated.
5. At the lower part of the web app, you can see the color codes of the picked color. For now, it provides values of RGB, HEX and HSL.
6. You can copy the target color code by clicking the it.

# Usage Scenario

None. I made this project just for fun. I cannot imagine what kind of situation I need to use it lol. If you find this web app is useful in some scenarios, please let me knowðŸ˜‚.
